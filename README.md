# nike-brand-website
Hi, Myself Rahul Tagra (Email-rahultagra04@gmail.com) has tried and implemented the (Task 5) i.e building a Website Of A Brand..Hope you Like It.<br>
So It is basically a nike (shoes)Brand Website.Open The (Brand.html) file.<br>[I have used Json and the PHP files only for running the Website In Heroku].<br><br>
1) The top most section of page is the header that consists of the nike logo with its name. The ["Nike" Name in the first line is a link and will take u to the The Official Nike Page Upon Clicking]. Same With The Bell Icon As Well As The USer Image [By clicking on the search button It Shows an Alert On The Window).<br><br>
2) After the header Section.. Navigation Section is there.. [The Nav section has options.. By clicking on them u will reach the desired section of the page].. The page is Responsive. So [If The Page width reduces to 1200px or more, The (Nav Items) will be gone and an "image of three horizontal bars will be displayed]" By hovering i.e placing the mouse on the image [all the Nav Items will be displayed in a dropdown].<br><br>
3) The Heading And The Nav Section Remains Fixed So That it Becomes Easy For Others To Directly Navigate To The Desired Section By Just Clicking .<br><br>
4) To Scroll Down [Please plase your mouse below the nav section] because nav and header sections are fixed.
The Page is Divided Into 2 Sections.[When the mouse Is on Left side the and u scroll down. then only left part will get scrolled down keeping the right part fixed and vice versa].<br><br>
5) The carousel  part has eye pleasing images . "which gets zoomed in on hovering the mouse over it".<br><br>
Now the mens shoes contains different small cards which contains the image and the information of the shoes.On Hovering the mouse over these cards the [border of these cards turns Red] . [The three dots in these cards are a dropdown menu which opens When We Hover The Mouse Over The Three Dots].The [dropdown menu contains The Options which act as a Link and Takes Us to The Actual Page Of The Shoes We Are seeing].<br><br>
6) All The features explained in Mens Section Are same for the [womens and the kids section]as well.<br>
7) The trending shoes section contains the shoes which are the best seller.. [On Hovering the image the Border turns GreenYellow] and [upon Clicking u are taken to the actual shoes page].<br><br>
8) The Carousel 1 images just below the trending shoes section does nothing but for the enhanement of the page.[on hovering the size increases and u are taken to the nike official website].<br><br>
9) There's an extra[click for more link] to find more shoes on the website itself.<br><br>
10) The last section in left part contains the shoes on Sale.[On hovering the border color changes and u are redirected to the shoes page].<br><br>
11) In the right part we have [Recently Viewed] Shoes.[in these too the three dots in the cards opens up a dropdown on hovering over the dots].and then upon clicking on the option in the dropdown u will reach the actual shoes page.
